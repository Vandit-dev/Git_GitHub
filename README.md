# Git_GitHub

## üìö Introduction to Git and GitHub
### What is Git?
- **Git** is a **distributed version control system** used for tracking changes in files during software development.
- It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, manage code versions, and maintain a history of changes.
- Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning-fast performance.

### Why Git?
- Advantages of Git over other version control systems:
    - **Speed and efficiency**: Handles projects of any size with lightning-fast performance.
    - **Local branching**: Developers can create branches easily for experimentation and collaboration.
    - **Staging areas**: Conveniently stage changes before committing them.
    - **Multiple workflows**: Supports various development workflows.

### What is GitHub?
- **GitHub** is a **web-based platform** built on top of Git.
- Provides additional features like collaboration tools, issue tracking, pull requests, and project management.
- Widely used by developers worldwide for hosting open-source repositories.

### Making Changes and Committing
1. Modify files (add code, update content).
2. Follow the Git workflow: `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

### Branching and Merging
1. Create branches for features or bug fixes.
2. Switch branches using `git checkout`.
3. Merge branches using `git merge`.

### Pull Requests
1. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub.
2. Discuss code changes and collaborate with others.

### GitHub Actions
- Explore automated workflows using GitHub Actions.


### Community and Collaboration
- Engage with other developers, attend meetups, and participate in hackathons.

# Types of Licenses in GitHub Repositories

## Overview
This Markdown file outlines some common types of licenses used in GitHub repositories.

## License Types

### MIT License
The MIT License is a permissive open-source license that allows users to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the code under the condition that the original copyright notice and permission notice are included.

### GNU General Public License (GPL)
The GNU GPL is a copyleft license that requires derived works to be distributed under the same terms as the original work. There are various versions of the GPL, such as GPL v2 and GPL v3, each with its own specific terms and conditions.

### Apache License
The Apache License is a permissive open-source license that allows users to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the code under the condition that the original copyright notice and permission notice are included, along with a disclaimer of warranty.

### Creative Commons Licenses
Creative Commons licenses are a family of licenses that allow creators to retain copyright while permitting certain uses of their work, such as sharing, remixing, and commercial use, depending on the specific license chosen (e.g., CC-BY, CC-BY-SA).

### GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
The GNU LGPL is a modified version of the GNU GPL that allows developers to link their proprietary applications with libraries released under the LGPL, while still requiring any modifications to the libraries themselves to be released under the LGPL.

### BSD License
The BSD License is a permissive open-source license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the code for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, with very few restrictions.

### ISC License
The ISC License is a permissive open-source license similar to the MIT License, with minimal restrictions on how the code can be used, modified, and distributed.

### Unlicense
The Unlicense is a public domain dedication that allows creators to waive all their copyright and related rights in a work, effectively placing it in the public domain.

## Conclusion
These are some of the common types of licenses you might encounter in GitHub repositories. It's essential to understand the terms and conditions of each license before using or contributing to a project.
